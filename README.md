# Z1-sprite-swaps
A place to store all of our z1 sprite swaps.

IPS patches for Headered Roms.

Pikachu is complete.  If you notice any errors or have suggestions, please post them!
The Pikachu set changes the swords to thunderbolts, changes the old man to oak, and old woman to nurse, and zelda
to another pikachu.  Ring colors show in the shield's lightning bolt and in Pikachu's stripes.


Samus sprite is wip, it's so much tougher than pikachu.  Please feel free to post suggestions!
Samus set changes the swords to bullets, the wand and wand magic to missiles, Zelda to baby metroid.
Ring colors change Samus' suit color.

Thanks so much for all the feedback and testing <3
Tetraly, megmacAttack, and everyone else who helped or encouraged us to do these!
